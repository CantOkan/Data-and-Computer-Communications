### Stop-and-Wait Flow Control
*  The simplest form of flow control, known as stop-and-wait flow control, works as
follows. A source entity transmits a frame. After the destination entity receives
the frame, it indicates its willingness to accept another frame by sending back an
acknowledgment to the frame just received. The source must wait until it receives
the acknowledgment before sending the next frame. The destination can thus stop
the flow of data simply by withholding acknowledgment. This procedure works fine
and, indeed, can hardly be improved upon when a message is sent in a few large
frames.  *
